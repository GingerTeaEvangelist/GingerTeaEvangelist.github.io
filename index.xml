      <description>Introduction The two data sets I used are “murder_2015_final” and “police_locals”.The “murder_2015_final” data set (m15f) contained five variables (two character and three numeric), and it had eighty-three observations. After tidying, the number of variables remained five (three character and two numerical), and it had a hundred and sixty-six observations. The “police_locals” data set (pl) contained eight variables (one character and seven numeric), and it had seventy-five observations. After tidying, it had four variables (two character and two numerical), and it had four hundred and fifty observations.</description>
