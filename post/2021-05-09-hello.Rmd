```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```
####Visualizing

Using ggplot to Visualize the highway miles travelled by the fuel type for different car types.

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
mpg <- as.data.frame(mpg)
str(mpg)
ggplot(mpg, aes(fl, hwy, color = class))+
  geom_point(alpha = .6)+
  theme_test()+
  ggtitle("Highway Miles Travelled by Fuel Type and Distinguished by Type of Car")+
  labs(y="Highway MPG", x="Fuel Type")
```

####Practicing with Python

Different Python functions and ways to use them.

```{python}

g=list(range(1,10,1))
len(g)
max(g)
min(g)

#Indexing
list1=[2,4,6,8]
list2=['a','s','d','f']
list1[3]
list2[2]
list1[-2]

#Lists
list1.reverse()
list1
list2.append(3)
list2
list3=list1+list2
list3

#Numpy
import numpy as np
h=np.array([2,4,6,8,10])
h.shape
h

#Strings
first = "Ozioma"
last = "Akahara"
first +' '+ last
last[:5]+first[3:]+' '+first[:2]+last[4:]
```

####Python and R Together

I used the Reticulate package to play with Python and R together

I did not have sexual relation with that woman

```{R}
library(reticulate)
What <- "woman"
important <- "with"
place <- "sexual"
Ms <- "not"
```


```{python}
an = "that"
work = "relations"
we = "have"
Lewinsky = "did"
at = "I"

print(at, Lewinsky, r.Ms, we, r.place, work, r.important, an, r.What)
```
